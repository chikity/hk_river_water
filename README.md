# Hong Kong Clean Rivers

## Welcome!

This project aims to answer the questions: "Are rivers in Hong Kong clean?" and "Which river is the cleanest".

Hong Kong as a small island city is actually surprisingly large.  The territory boasts roughly around 200 small mountain streams and a couple dozen or so major rivers.  These major rivers are routinely monitored for their water quality by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) of Hong Kong since 1986.
